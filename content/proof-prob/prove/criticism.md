## [How to Prove It, by Daniel J. Velleman](../)

{{< toc >}}

### General Criticism

In my layman opinion, as an introduction to proof-writing, this book is a bit too logic-based to be accessible. I had to struggle through quite a few of the chapters explaining sentential logic and first-order logic, and I learned as much from googling as from the book (see the [Specific Criticism](#specific-criticism)). That's not necessarily a bad thing, but again, it's not beginner-friendly. It would have been 10x better if, interspersed within the more dry logic chapters were lessons on more vernacular proof-writing. Logic is tough, but it is even tougher and confusing (not to mention, a drag) when you get very deep into the lore.

I would recommend skipping these parts and coming back to them when you feel you can not progress without learning them.

### Specific Criticism

1.  Between [§1.1](../ch1/#chapter-11--deductive-reasoning-and-logical-connectives) and [§1.5](../ch1/#chapter-15--the-conditional-and-biconditional-connectives), Author doesn't elaborate on the relationship
    between propositions, statements, and arguments. In fact, he doesn't
    mention propositions at all. He doesn't elaborate on function
    propositions either, thus.
2.  The author doesn't explain the principle of vacuous truth in [§1.5](../ch1/#chapter-15--the-conditional-and-biconditional-connectives),
    and thus leaves the reader confused as to why the last two lines of
    the truth table are true. His attempt at an explanation just leaves one _more_ confused.
3.  The author gives examples demanding more advanced operations on sets in [§2.1](../ch2/#chapter-21--quantifiers) & [§2.2](../ch2/#chapter-22--equivalences-involving-quantifiers) before defining them in [§2.3](../ch2/#chapter-23--more-operations-on-sets).
4.  The author uses maths unnecessarily, when it would be more illustrative and easier to understand his examples (like of sets and families of sets) if he were to use vernacular examples.
