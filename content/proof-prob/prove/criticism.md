### Criticism

1.  Between [ยง1.1](../ch1/#chapter-11--deductive-reasoning-and-logical-connectives) and [ยง1.5](../ch1/#chapter-15--the-conditional-and-biconditional-connectives), Author doesn't elaborate on the relationship
    between propositions, statements, and arguments. In fact, he doesn't
    mention propositions at all. He doesn't elaborate on function
    propositions either, thus.
2.  The author doesn't explain the principle of vacuous truth in [ยง1.5](../ch1/#chapter-15--the-conditional-and-biconditional-connectives),
    and thus leaves the reader confused as to why the last two lines of
    the truth table are true. His attempt at an explanation just leaves one _more_ confused.
