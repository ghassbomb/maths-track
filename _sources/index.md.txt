# Maths Track

## The Plan

My goal is to work through a (roughly) **undergraduate** course in Mathematics, within an year. The actual notes are in LaTeX PDF files, which you can download — since Sphinx maths support is pretty limited.
```{warning}
This list is **not** final, and it may be subject to changes. I will **not** be linearly solving these books, either — I will sometimes go back to a previous book at a certain time, solve two books simultaneously, etc.
```
