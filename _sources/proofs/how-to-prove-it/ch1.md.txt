# Chapter 1 — Sentential Logic

## Chapter 1.1 — Deductive Reasoning and Logical Connectives

### Notes

Proofs are based on deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning involves
arriving at a _conclusion_ from one or more _premises_. The fruit of the
whole process, including our premises and conclusion, is an argument.
For instance, we have the argument:

1.  It will either rain or snow tomorrow
2.  It will not snow tomorrow
3.  Therefore, it will rain tommorrow

Here, the first two statements are our premises, and the final is our
conclusion deducted/derived from them. If our premises are true, and our conclusion is true, then the argument is said to be _valid_. Put another way, an argument is valid if it is impossible for the premises to be true, but the conclusion false. We could also say that, if the conclusion is false, then at least one of the premises must be false (for the argument to be valid).

Note that it is possibly for the premises to be false and the conclusion true, and that this has no effect on our argument. Our argument is only concerned with the relationship between the selected premises and conclusion; if the conclusion is true for some other reason, it has no bearing on the validity of our argument.

Propositions make up a statement (which make up arguments). Here, the
two main propositions are 'It will rain tomorrow' and 'It will snow
tomorrow'. We can restate propositions as letters instead of grammar;
this is a convenient way of removing the 'fluff' and not getting
confused by the irrelevant details, as we often do. Thus, we can restate
our last argument as:

1.  P or Q
2.  not P
3.  Therefore, Q

Where P is the propsosition 'it will rain tomorrow', and Q means 'it
will snow tomorrow'. You can substitute the propositions back into the
lean logical statement and it will be perfectly viable grammatically.

But we haven't removed all words: 'or', 'not', and 'therefore' remain.
We have logical operators, sometimes called logical _connectives_, to
replace them: $\vee, \wedge, \neg$ correspond to 'or', 'and', 'not'; we
use the verbs 'disjunction', 'adjunction', and 'negation' to describe
their effects on statements (e.g. $P \vee Q$ is the disjunction of P and
Q). There is also a 'therefore' connective: $\therefore$.

With this, we have a logic language of sorts. We can again rewrite the
argument using this language:

1.  $P \vee Q$
2.  $\neg P$
3.  $\therefore Q$

For longer operations, we can use parentheses to indicate order of
operations as in arithmetic. For instance:
$(P \wedge Q) \vee (P \wedge R)$.

## Chapter 1.2 — Truth Tables

### Notes

We use _truth tables_ to evaluate the verity of a logical proposition,
statement, or argument. A proposition or a statement is either _true_ or
_false_; for instance, the statement 'it is currently winter' is either
true or false, no two ways about it. Also remember that, in order for an
argument to be valid, it must satisfy the following condition: if all
the premises are true then it _must_ also be true. We will see how to
interpret this with respect to a truth table.

To go back to our last example, the proposition 'P' can only be true or
false; in the former case, that means 'it will rain tomorrow' and in the
latter that means 'it will not rain tomorrow'. The same goes for
$P \vee Q$, a statement; in this case, if either $P$ or $Q$ is true,
then the whole statement will be true as well. In truth table form, it
is written as such:

| P   | Q   | $P \vee Q$ | $\neg Q$ | $\therefore P$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | -------- | -------------- |
| T   | T   | F          | F        | F              |
| T   | F   | T          | T        | T              |
| F   | T   | T          | F        | F              |
| F   | F   | F          | T        | F              |

**Note**: There are two types of 'or' statements: inclusive, and
exclusive or. With inclusive or, if both P and Q are true, then the
whole statement can also be true. The opposite is true of exclusive or,
which applies a stricter interpretation of 'or'; if both propositions
are true, the statement is false. You should assume that a statement is
inclusive, unless specified otherwise.

Here, we assume that it is not possible for it to _both_ rain and snow
tomorrow, and thus we are to assume an exclusive or. There is only one
possibility where it rains tomorrow: when it will not snow tomorrow, and
thus $\neg Q$ returns T, but it will rain tomorrow, and thus P and
$P \vee Q$ return T.

Onto the real question: is this argument valid? We have two premises
(3rd and 4th column), and a conclusion (5th column). There is only one
case where both premises are true (2nd row), and in that case the
conclusion is also true. Therefore, the argument is said to be valid. If
there were even a single line where all the premises were true and the
conclusion was false, the argument would be considered invalid. (Refer
back to §2.1.1 if you suffer any confusion)

A _tautology_ is a statement that is always true, whereas a
_contradiction_ is one that is never true. A tautology (grammatically)
could be something like 'a friend is a friend', whereas a contradiction
(grammatically) would be 'an enemy is a friend'. The conjunction of P
and a tautology is always P, the adjunction of P and a tautology is
itself a tautology, and the negation of a tautology is always a
contradiction. This can be seen below: $P \vee Q$ is always true (a
tautology) because Q is always true; $P \wedge Q$ is dependent on the
value of P, and thus is P; $\neg Q$ is always false (a contradiction),
because Q is always true.

| P   | Q   | $P \vee Q$ | $P \wedge Q$ | $\neg Q$ |
| --- | --- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- |
| T   | T   | T          | T            | F        |
| T   | T   | T          | T            | F        |
| F   | T   | T          | F            | F        |
| F   | T   | T          | F            | F        |

## Chapter 1.3 — Variables and Sets

### Notes

We previously dealt with representing propositions with 'P' or 'Q';
these are not _variables_ per-se. Variables in logic have _free_ or
_bound_ values. For instance, in the function $f(x)=x+1$, $x$ can be any
real number and is thus free. We can integrate these into logic as well.
For the proposition '$x$ is a prime number', we can use $f(x)$ (as
opposed to 'P'); if $x$ is in fact prime, this will be true.

These propositions don't have to be strictly mathematical, and can be
multivariate. $f(x, y)$ could mean '$x$, $y$ are men'. We can also use
connectives with these statements: $f(x,y) \wedge g(z)$, where $f(x,y)$
means the same thing as above, and $g(z)$ means '$z$ is a woman'.

These propositions cannot simply be true or false, since they depend on
variables. We can define _truth sets_ for them where, if the variable is
contained in the _set_, the proposition will be true. A set is a
collection of _elements_ and we can use the connective $\in$ to say
something is 'an element of' a set. To define a set, we use the
following language: $A = \{x \mid x \text{ is a prime}\}$, which means
something like 'A is equal to the set of all x such that ($\mid$) $x$ is
a prime number'. This is known as _set builder notation_. The part after
the $\mid$ is an _elementhood test_, which basically determines if an
item is fit to be an element in the set. If we were to ask, 'is
$5 \in A$?', we would check if 5 is a prime and if it were true (it is),
then 5 is in fact an element of A.

Going back to free and bound variables, our statement that $5 \in A$ can
be rephrased as $y \in \{x \mid x \text{ is a prime} \}$. Here, we can
substitute $y = 5$, or $y = 3$, or any number that is prime. But we
cannot substitute anything into $x$; $x$ is a dummy variable, it is
bound. It does not function like an actual variable, but is merely used
to replace the function of a number. $y$, on the other hand and as we
demonstrated, can be replaced with any number and is thus free.

The _universe of discourse_ of a statement or argument is essentially
the set of all objects that this statement concerns itself with. For
instance, for the set A, its universe of discourse would be every real
number (because only real numbers can be prime). We can represent this
thus: $A = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \text{ is a prime}\}$.

The truth set of a tautology would be the universe of discourse itself;
for instance, if there is a proposition
$\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x^2 > 0\}$; since $x^2 > 0$ is a tautology,
then every element of the universe of discourse $\mathbb{R}$ is an
element of this set (since all the elements of the universe pass the
test). The opposite, if the proposition is a contradiction, would be an
empty set. We can denote an empty set with the symbol $\emptyset$. Similar to an empty set is the idea of two _disjoint_ sets — two sets which have no common elements.

## Chapter 1.4 — Operations on Sets

### Notes

The question now becomes, how do we deal with statements made up of
function propositions? For instance, what would the truth set of a
function proposition like $P(x) \wedge G(x)$ be?

We would need to operate on the truth sets of both functions (A and B)
in order to determine this. Furthermore, we can use a special
set-language for these types of operations, to make solving these
problems easier. It consists of: $\cap, \cup, \setminus$; intersection,
union, and difference respectively. The intersection of two sets would
be the elements that are common to both of them, while the union of two
sets would be all of the elements of both, combined. The difference of
two sets would be the elements in one set but not in the other, or we
can also consider it the removal of elements in a set from another; like
subtraction, it is _not_ commutative. The results of these operations
are themselves sets.

For instance, operations on the aforementioned sets, A
$= \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ and B $=\\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$, would be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  A \cup B & = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}
  \\\\ A \cap B &= \\{3, 4, 5\\}
  \\\\ A \setminus B &= \\{1, 2\\}
  \\\\ B \setminus A &= \\{6, 7\\}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the results of these operations are themselves sets, reformulating
them in set builder notation would show us the general method of an
operation. They are thus:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  A \cup B      & = \\{x \mid x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\\}      \\\\
  A \cap B      & = \\{x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\\}     \\\\
  A \setminus B & = \\{x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B \\}
\end{aligned}
$$

Going back to our original question: what is the truth set of
$P(x) \wedge G(x)$? Let us assume that set A is the truth set of $P(x)$
and set B is the truth set of $G(x)$. We can see that the connective in
the statement $P(x) \wedge G(x)$ is an adjunction; we need to find its
set equivalent to apply on the two truth sets A and B, and its answer
will be the truth set of the _whole_ statement. A cursory glance at the
sets in set builder notation shows us that the answer is $A \cap B$; it
utilises 'and' and does not contain the 'not in' ($\notin$) symbol.

Therefore, in order to obtain the truth set of the statement
$P(x) \wedge G(x)$, and assuming that the truth set of $P(x)$ is A, and
$G(x)$ is B, we perform the operation $A \cap B$ with a result of
$\{3, 4, 5\}$. Since the result of this operation is a set, we can also
use the following set notation: $x \in A \cap B$ to refer to the
elements of the set. Expanding that further, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  x & \in A \cap B                          \\\\
  x & \in \{y \mid y \in A \wedge y \in B\} \\\\
  x & \in A \wedge x \in B
\end{aligned}$$ and other logical forms depending on the set operation.
This shows us more clearly the relationship between set operations and
logical connectives.

Once we have converted set operations into logical connectives, we can
apply equivalence rules on them as well. For instance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x & \in A \cap (B \cup C) \\\\
x & \in A \cap (x \in B \vee x \in C) \text{ (definition of $\cup$)} \\\\
x & \in A \wedge (x \in B \vee x \in C) \text{ (definition of $\cap$)} \\\\
(x & \in A \wedge x \in B) \vee (x \in A \wedge x \in C) \text{ (distributive law)}
\end{aligned}
$$

If you wish, you can also substitute the propositions in these
statements (i.e. $x \in A$) with letters, to completely convert them
into logical statements.

## Chapter 1.5 — The Conditional and Biconditional Connectives
### Notes

There is a sort of argument form that we have left untouched until now:

1. If I am hungry, then I must eat
2. I am hungry
3. Therefore, I must eat

You might have some trouble writing the first line as a logical
statement. In proper terms, it is written as: $P \rightarrow Q$. This is
a conditional statement, and the topic of this part. Conditional
statements are simple to understand: _if_ one statement is true, _then_
another statement is also true. If P is true, then Q is true. Here, P is
the _antecedent_ and Q is the _consequent_. Everything before the
conditional connective '$\rightarrow$' is the antecedent, and after it comes
the consequent.

The truth table for a conditional statement is as follows:

| P | Q | $P \rightarrow Q$ |
|---|---|-------------------|
| T | T | T                 |
| T | F | F                 |
| F | T | T                 |
| F | F | T                 |

The first possibility is simple enough: if the antecedent is true, and
the consequent is true, then the statement is true. The second one is
also simple: the antecedent is true but the consequent is false, and
thus the statement is false.

The third one is a bit more confusing: if the antecedent is false, but
the consequent is still true (likely by virtue of some other factor), is
our statement true or false? For instance, if we say that 'If I am
hungry, then I must eat', but at one point I eat even when I am not
hungry, maybe to taste test. Q is true, but P is false. Does this render
our entire statement untenable, or is it simply an exception?

And the final one is tough as well: if our antecedent is false and our
consequent is false, is this because our statement is true, or is it
because there is no link between the two statements and both are merely
false by coincidence?

In these last two cases, the statement is a _vacuous truth_, because the
antecedent is false. It is by default true, simply because the statement
is meaningless and its verity is thus irrelevant. For instance, suppose
I promise to a friend: 'if Pakistan win the next ODI World Cup, I'll buy
you a dinner at Cosa Nostra'. If Pakistan win and I buy him a dinner, I
didn't lie. My statement is true. If Pakistan win and I don't buy him a
dinner, I lied, so my statement is false. These are the first two lines.

Let us suppose that Pakistan lose and I don't buy him a dinner; I
_could_ have been lying, but since Pakistan lost it doesn't matter. I
told the truth, by an objective standard, and my statement is thus true,
though a vacuous truth. It corresponds to line 4. Line 3 would be the
case where Pakistan lose and I buy him a dinner anyways. Again, it
doesn't affect my statement at all; you can't say I lied, after all I
made no provision for a case like this in my statement. Thus, my
statement is a vacuous truth.

Another way to write conditionals is in the form: $\neg P \vee Q$.
Grammatically, we can write this as (with some liberties) : 'I'm not
hungry, or I'd be eating'. Its truth table is identical. Most
importantly, we can use this to gleam some other truths about
conditionals. For instance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \neg P \vee Q & = \neg P \vee \neg \neg Q                      \\\\
                & = \neg (P \vee \neg Q) \text{ (De Morgan's law)}
\end{aligned}
$$

This leads us into another explanation:

1. If I am hungry, then I must eat $(P \rightarrow Q)$
2. I must eat $(Q)$
3. Therefore, I am hungry $(\therefore P)$

is obviously invalid logic. Specifically, it would only
be true if the first statement was instead its _converse_; if
$P \rightarrow Q$ was $Q \rightarrow P$. But is there a way to put Q on
the other side of the right arrow? Yes, and it is a very important
method of proof: _contraposition_.

Essentially, we flip the entire statement
$P \rightarrow Q = Q \rightarrow P$ and then negate that. It then turns
into $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$. If the original statement is true,
then this contraposition must be true, and vice versa. Grammatically, it
can be expressed as 'If I am not eating, then I am not hungry'.

Part of the problem with everyday intuitionistic logic and the more
formal logic we study is that of implied meaning. When I say that 'if
you don't get full marks, you're grounded.' the other person likely
thinks (correctly) that if he _does_ get full marks he won't be
grounded, even though that is not actually specified; it is implied.
This sort of blurry meaning is incompatible with maths. Therefore, for
such statements, we use the following language '_iff_ you don't get full
marks, you're grounded'. This can be expressed as: $P \iff Q$.

### Exercises
1.  1.  $(P \vee \neg Q) \rightarrow \neg R$ where $P$ means 'the gas
        has an unpleasant smell', $Q$ means 'this gas is explosive', and
        $R$ means 'this gas is hydrogen'.
    2.  $(P \wedge Q) \rightarrow R$ where $P$ means 'George has a
        fever', $Q$ means 'George has a headache', and $R$ means 'George
        is going to the doctor.
    3.  $(P \vee Q) \rightarrow R$ with the same meanings.
    4.  $\neg f(x) \wedge g(x) \rightarrow p(x)$ where
        $f(x), g(x), p(x)$ mean '$x$ is equal to 2', '$x$ is odd', and
        '$x$ is a prime', respectively.
2.  1.  Where $P$ is 'sales will go up', $Q$ is 'expenses will go up',
        and $R$ is 'the boss will be happy'. The argument is **valid**.
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
          P \vee Q             \\\\
          P \rightarrow R      \\\\
          Q \rightarrow \neg R \\\\
          \therefore \neg (P \wedge Q)
        \end{aligned}
        $$
    2.  Where P means 'the warning light will come on', Q means 'the
        pressure is too high' and R means 'the relief valve is clogged'.
        **Invalid**.
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        (Q \wedge R) \rightarrow P \\\\ \neg R \\\\ \therefore Q \rightarrow P
        \end{aligned}
        $$
