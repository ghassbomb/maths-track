  - How to Solve It, by George Polya
- Linear Algebra
  - Linear Algebra, by Serge Lang
- Real Analysis
  - Principles of Mathematical Analysis, by Walter Rudin
  - Understanding Analysis, by Stephen Abbott
  - Calculus, by Michael Spivak
- Complex Analysis
  - Complex Analysis, by Joseph Bak, et. al
  - Visual Complex Analysis, by Tristan Needham
- ODE & PDE
  - Ordinary Differential Equations, by Morris Tenenbaum, et. al
  - Partial Differential Equations: An Introduction, by Walter Strauss
  - Fourier Series, by Georgi Tolstov 

## Details

This repository exists for three main reasons:

- To function as a sort of track for my progress in learning the elements of mathematics
- To contain my notes and exercises as I work through various books
- For the reference of other people who may want to teach themselves mathematics

**My goal is to work through an undergraduate level course worth of Mathematics, before finishing my A-levels (2 years)**. I doubt I will succeed, but when setting goals it's nice to be optimistic, no? Works as a motivator.

Because I will be doing this in tandem with my A-levels, and the main focus in the A-levels Mathematics syllabus around this time is Calculus, I will not be studying Calculus on my own outside of school. 

I will learn through *books* for the most part, because I am most comfortable with them. When I work through books, I study through them maybe one or two hours a day, or till I complete a certain part/subchapter, and the exercises as well.

I will take notes and solve exercises using LaTeX. For more complex problems, I will likely attempt them using paper and pencil before transcribing.

Note: This plan is highly theoretical, at least for now. It's a compilation of internet wisdom, and not really a complete work yet.
